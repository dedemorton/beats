Use the `udp` input to read events over UDP.

Example configuration:

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"]

- type: udp
  max_message_size: 10240
----


==== Configuration options

The `udp` input supports the following configuration options plus the
<<{type}-input-common-options>> described later.

//REVIEWERS: What other options need to be documented here? I don't see host
//and port listed in the reference.yml. Are the host and port separate options?
//What guidance should we provide to help users set these options? Config ex
//above should include this as an eample, too.
