When you install and run {agent}, it creates files in the following locations.

== deb and rpm

These paths are set in the init script or in the systemd unit file. Make sure
that you start the {agent} service by using the preferred operating system
method (init scripts or `systemctl`). Otherwise the paths might be set
incorrectly.
