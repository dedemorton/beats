= Run {agent}

experimental[]

{agent} runs in two modes: standalone or fleet. The two modes differ in how you
configure and manage the Agent.

[float]
[[fleet-mode]]
== Run in {fleet} mode

With _fleet mode_, you manage {agent} remotely. The Agent uses a trusted {kib}
instance to retrieve configurations and report Agent events. This trusted {kib}
instance must have {ingest-manager} and {fleet} enabled.

To create a trusted communication channel between {agent} and {kib}, enroll the
Agent to {fleet}.

To enroll an {agent} to {fleet}:

. Stop the Agent, if it's already running.

. Go the **{fleet}** tab in {ingest-manager}, and click **Enroll new agent** to
generate a token. See <<ingest-management-getting-started>> for detailed steps.

. Enroll the Agent:

[float]
[[standalone-mode]]
== Run in standalone mode (default)

With _standalone mode_, you manually configure and manage the Agent locally.
Each Agent is configured to be in standalone mode by default after installation.

If {agent} is installed as an auto-starting service, it will run automatically
when you restart your system.

To start {agent} manually, run:

include::tab-widgets/run-standalone-linux-mac-win-widget.asciidoc[]

Use the `-c` flag to specify the configuration file. If no configuration file is
specified, {agent} uses the default configuration, `elastic-agent.yml`, which is
located in the same directory as {agent}.

For configuration options, see <<elastic-agent-configuration>>.
