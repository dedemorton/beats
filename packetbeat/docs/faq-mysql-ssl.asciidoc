=== {beatname_uc} isn't capturing MySQL performance data?

You may be listening on the wrong interface or trying to capture data sent over
an encrypted connection. {beatname_uc} is unable to capture data sent over
encrypted connections. To resolve your issue:

* Make sure {beatname_uc} is configured to listen on the `lo0` interface:
+
[source,shell]
-----
packetbeat.interfaces.device: lo0
-----

* Make sure the client programs you are monitoring run `mysql` with SSL
disabled. For example:
+
[source,shell]
-----
mysql --protocol tcp --host=127.0.0.1 --port=3306 --ssl-mode=DISABLED
-----
